# ZapLapsSiteRevamped
Remaking site in the ZapLabsSite repository, more information on why in the README. 

The goal of this project was to create a functional website using only css and html. My first pass worked but could have been better.  Since I am somewhat new to these languages I created a seperate project with the goal of cleaner code to see how much of it I could do without referencing the origional.  It also tracks (in painful detail) all of my comments so I would be forced to justify every line which I am hoping helps me better identify the heirerchy of css to avoid unused/spaghetti/redundant code.
